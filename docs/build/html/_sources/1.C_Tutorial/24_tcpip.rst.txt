Chapter 24 TCP/IP
=========================
In this chapter, we will introduce how ESP32-S3 implements network communications 
based on TCP/IP protocol. There are two roles in TCP/IP communication, namely 
Server and Client, which will be implemented respectively with two projects in 
this chapter.

Project 24.1 As Client
------------------------
In this section, ESP32-S3 is used as Client to connect Server on the same LAN 
and communicate with it.

**Install Processing** 
In this tutorial, we use Processing to build a simple TCP/IP communication 
platform. If you've not installed Processing, you can download it by clicking 
https://processing.org/download/. You can choose an appropriate version to downl
oad according to your PC system.

.. image:: img/other/processing1.png

Unzip the downloaded file to your computer. Click "processing.exe" as the figure 
below to run this software.

**Use Server mode for communication**

Install ControlP5.

.. image:: img/other/processing3.png

.. image:: img/other/processing0.png

Open the “Super_Starter_Kit_for_ESP32_S3\\Sketches\\Sketches\\Sketch_24.1_
WiFiClient\\sketchWiFi\\Processing_wifi.pde”, and click "Run".

.. image:: img/other/processing4.png

The new pop-up interface is as follows. If ESP32-S3 is used as client, select 
TCP SERVER mode for sketchWiFi.

When sketchWiFi selects TCP SERVER mode, ESP32-S3 Sketch needs to be changed 
according to sketchWiFi's displaying of LOCAL IP or LOCAL PORT.

When sketchWiFi selects TCP CLIENT mode, the LOCAL IP and LOCAL PORT of sketchWi
Fi need to be changed according to the IP address and port number printed by the 
serial monitor.

**Mode selection**: select Server mode/Client mode. 

**IP address**: In server mode, this option does not need to be filled in, and the computer will automatically obtain 
the IP address. In client mode, fill in the remote IP address to be connected.

**Port number**: In server mode, fill in a port number for client devices to make an 
access connection. In client mode, fill in port number given by the Server devices 
to make an access connection.

**Start button**: In server mode, push the button, then the computer will serve as 
server and open a port number for client to make access connection. During this 
period, the computer will keep monitoring. In client mode, before pushing the 
button, please make sure the server is on, remote IP address and remote port number 
is correct; push the button, and the computer will make access connection to the 
remote port number of the remote IP as a client.

**clear receive**: clear out the content in the receiving text box 
**clear send**: clear out the content in the sending text box 
**Sending button**: push the sending button, the computer will send the content in 
the text box to others.

Connect
^^^^^^^

Sketch
^^^^^^^
Before running the Sketch, please open “Processing_wifi.pde.” first, and click “Run”.

.. image:: img/software/24.3.png

The newly pop up window will use the computer’s IP address by default and open a 
data monitor port.

.. image:: img/other/processing4-1.png

Next, open Sketch_24.1_WiFiClient.ino. Before running it, please change the foll
owing information based on "LOCAL IP" and "LOCAL PORT" in the figure above.

.. image:: img/software/24.1.png

REMOTE_IP needs to be filled in according to the interface of Processing_wifi.pde. 
Taking this tutorial as an example, its REMOTE_IP is “192.168.2.112”. Generally, 
by default, the ports do not need to change its value.

Click LISTENING, turn on TCP SERVER's data listening function and wait for 
ESP32-S3 to connect.

.. image:: img/other/processing4-2.png

Compile and upload code to ESP32-S3 WROOM, open the serial monitor and set the 
baud rate to 115200. ESP32-S3 connects router, obtains IP address and sends access 
request to server IP address on the same LAN till the connection is successful. 
When connect successfully, ESP32-S3 can send messages to server.

.. image:: img/phenomenon/24.1.png

ESP32-S3 connects with TCP SERVER, and TCP SERVER receives messages from ESP32-S3, 
as shown in the figure below.

**Sketch_24.1_As_Client**
Code
^^^^^^
The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: C

    #include <WiFi.h>

    const char *ssid_Router     =  "xxxxxxxxxxx"; //Enter the router name
    const char *password_Router =  "xxxxxxxxxxx"; //Enter the router password
    #define     REMOTE_IP          "xxxxxxxxxxx"  //input the remote server which is you want to connect
    #define     REMOTE_PORT         8888       //input the remote port which is the remote provide
    WiFiClient client;

    void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    delay(10);

    WiFi.begin(ssid_Router, password_Router);
    Serial.print("\nWaiting for WiFi... ");
    while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
        Serial.print(".");
        delay(500);
    }
    Serial.println("");
    Serial.println("WiFi connected");
    Serial.println("IP address: ");
    Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
    delay(500);

    Serial.print("Connecting to ");
    Serial.println(REMOTE_IP);

    while (!client.connect(REMOTE_IP, REMOTE_PORT)) {
        Serial.println("Connection failed.");
        Serial.println("Waiting a moment before retrying...");
    }
    Serial.println("Connected");
    client.print("Hello\n");
    client.print("This is my IP.\n");
    }

    void loop() {
    if (client.available() > 0) {
        delay(20);
        //read back one line from the server
        String line = client.readString();
        Serial.println(REMOTE_IP + String(":") + line);
    }
    if (Serial.available() > 0) {
        delay(20);
        String line = Serial.readString();
        client.print(line);
    }
    if (client.connected () == 0) {
        client.stop();
        WiFi.disconnect();
    }
    }



Project 24.2 As Server
------------------------
In this section, ESP32-S3 is used as a server to wait for the connection and com
munication of client on the same LAN.

Connect
^^^^^^^^
Connect ESP32-S3 to the computer using a USB cable.

.. image:: img/0/connect1.png

Sketch
^^^^^^^
Before running Sketch, please modify the contents of the box below first.

**Sketch_24.2_As_Server**

.. image:: img/software/24.2.png

Compile and upload code to ESP32-S3 WROOM board, open the serial monitor and set 
the baud rate to 115200. Turn on server mode for ESP32-S3, waiting for the connec
tion of other devices on the same LAN. Once a device connects to server success
fully, they can send messages to each other. If the ESP32-S3 fails to connect to 
router, press the reset button as shown below and wait for ESP32-S3 to run again.

.. image:: img/phenomenon/24.2.png

Processing： Open the “Super_Starter_Kit_for_ESP32_S3\\Sketches\\Sketches
\\Sketch_24.2_WiFiServer\\sketchWiFi\\Processing_wifi.pde”. Based on the messages printed 
by the serial monitor, enter correct IP address and serial port in Processing to 
establish connection and make communication.

.. image:: img/other/processing24.2.png
    
Code
^^^^^^
The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: C

    #include <WiFi.h>

    #define port 80
    const char *ssid_Router      = "********";  //input your wifi name
    const char *password_Router  = "********";  //input your wifi passwords
    WiFiServer  server(port);

    void setup()
    {
        Serial.begin(115200);
        Serial.printf("\nConnecting to ");
        Serial.println(ssid_Router);
        WiFi.disconnect();
        WiFi.begin(ssid_Router, password_Router);
        delay(1000);
        while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
            delay(500);
            Serial.print(".");
        }
        Serial.println("");
        Serial.println("WiFi connected.");
        Serial.print("IP address: ");
        Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());			
        Serial.printf("IP port: %d\n",port);			
        server.begin(port);								
        WiFi.setAutoReconnect(true);
    }

    void loop(){
    WiFiClient client = server.accept();               // listen for incoming clients
    if (client) {                                     // if you get a client,
        Serial.println("Client connected.");
        while (client.connected()) {                    // loop while the client's connected
        if (client.available()) {                     // if there's bytes to read from the client,
            Serial.println(client.readStringUntil('\n')); // print it out the serial monitor
            while(client.read()>0);                     // clear the wifi receive area cache
        }
        if(Serial.available()){                       // if there's bytes to read from the serial monitor,
            client.print(Serial.readStringUntil('\n')); // print it out the client.
            while(Serial.read()>0);                     // clear the wifi receive area cache
        }
        }
        client.stop();                                  // stop the client connecting.
        Serial.println("Client Disconnected.");
    }
    }
