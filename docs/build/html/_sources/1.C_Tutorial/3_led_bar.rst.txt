Chapter 3 LED Bar
=========================
We have learned how to control a LED blinking, next we will learn how to control 
a number of LEDs.

Project 3.1 Flowing Light
--------------------------
In this project, we use a number of LEDs to make a flowing light.

Component List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Raspberry Pi Pico W x1

- 830 Tie-Points Breadboard x1
- Resistor 220Ω x10
- Jumper Wire Several
- LED Bar Graph x1

Connect
^^^^^^^

If LED bar does not work, try to rotate it for 180°. The label is random.

Sketch
^^^^^^^
This project is designed to make a flowing water lamp. Which are these actions: 
First turn LED1 ON, then turn it OFF. Then turn LED2 ON, and then turn it OFF... 
and repeat the same to all 10 LEDs until the last LED is turns OFF. This process 
is repeated to achieve the “movements” of flowing water. 
Upload following sketch:

Download the code to ESP32-S3 WROOM and LED bar graph will light up from left to 
right and from right to left.

Code
^^^^^^
The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: C

    byte ledPins[] = {21, 47, 48, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 2, 1};
    int ledCounts;

    void setup() {
    ledCounts = sizeof(ledPins);
    for (int i = 0; i < ledCounts; i++) {
        pinMode(ledPins[i], OUTPUT);
        }
    }

    void loop() {
    for (int i = 0; i < ledCounts; i++) {
        digitalWrite(ledPins[i], HIGH);
        delay(100);
        digitalWrite(ledPins[i], LOW);
    }
    for (int i = ledCounts - 1; i > -1; i--) {
        digitalWrite(ledPins[i], HIGH);
        delay(100);
        digitalWrite(ledPins[i], LOW);
        }
    }
