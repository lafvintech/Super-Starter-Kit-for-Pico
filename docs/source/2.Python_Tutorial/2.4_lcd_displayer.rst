2.4 LCD Displayer
=========================
LCD1602 is a character type liquid crystal display, which can display 32 (16*2) 
characters at the same time.

As we all know, though LCD and some other displays greatly enrich the man-machine 
interaction, they share a common weakness. When they are connected to a controller, 
multiple IOs will be occupied of the controller which has no so many outer ports. 
Also it restricts other functions of the controller. Therefore, LCD1602 with an 
I2C bus is developed to solve the problem.

Here we will use the I2C1 interface to control the LCD1602 and display text.

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``2.4_lcd_displayer.py`` file under the path of ``Super-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Python\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

Click “Run current script”, you will be able to see two lines of text appear on the LCD in turn, and then disappear.

The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: python

    from machine import I2C, Pin
    from lcd1602 import LCD
    import time

    # Initialize I2C communication;
    i2c = I2C(1, sda=Pin(14), scl=Pin(15), freq=400000)

    # Create an LCD object for interfacing with the LCD1602 display
    lcd = LCD(i2c)

    # Display the first message on the LCD
    # Use '\n' to create a new line.
    string = "From Lafvin"
    lcd.message(string)
    # Wait for 2 seconds
    time.sleep(2)
    # Clear the display
    lcd.clear()

    # Display the second message on the LCD
    string = "Hello\n       World!"
    lcd.message(string)
    # Wait for 5 seconds
    time.sleep(5)
    # Clear the display before exiting
    lcd.clear()
