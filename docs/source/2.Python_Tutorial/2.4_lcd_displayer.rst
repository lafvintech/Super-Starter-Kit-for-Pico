2.4 LCD Displayer
=========================
The LCD1602 is a character-based liquid crystal display capable of showing 32 
characters at once, arranged in two rows of 16 characters each.

While LCDs and other displays enhance human-machine interaction, they often have a 
drawback: connecting them to a controller occupies multiple I/O ports, which are 
limited in number. This can also restrict the controller's other functions. To address 
this issue, the LCD1602 with an I²C bus interface was developed.

In this project, we will use the I²C1 interface to control the LCD1602 and display text.

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``2.4_lcd_displayer.py`` file under the path of ``Ultimate-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Python\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

Click “Run current script”, you will be able to see two lines of text appear on the LCD in turn, and then disappear.

The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: python

    from machine import I2C, Pin
    from lcd1602 import LCD
    import time

    # Initialize I2C communication;
    i2c = I2C(1, sda=Pin(6), scl=Pin(7), freq=400000)

    # Create an LCD object for interfacing with the LCD1602 display
    lcd = LCD(i2c)

    # Display the first message on the LCD
    # Use '\n' to create a new line.
    string = "From Lafvin"
    lcd.message(string)
    # Wait for 2 seconds
    time.sleep(2)
    # Clear the display
    lcd.clear()

    # Display the second message on the LCD
    string = "Hello\n       World!"
    lcd.message(string)
    # Wait for 5 seconds
    time.sleep(5)
    # Clear the display before exiting
    lcd.clear()
