3.1 Joystick
=========================
If you play a lot of video games, then you should be very familiar with the Joystick. It is usually used to move the character around, rotate the screen, etc.

The principle behind Joystick’s ability to allow the computer to read our actions is very simple. It can be thought of as consisting of two potentiometers that are perpendicular to each other. These two potentiometers measure the analog value of the joystick vertically and horizontally, resulting in a value (x,y) in a planar right-angle coordinate system.

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``3.1_joystick.py`` file under the path of ``Ultimate-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Python\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

Click “Run current script”, the Shell prints out the x,y,z values of joystick.

* The x-axis and y-axis values are analog values that vary from 0 to 65535.

The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: python

    import machine
    import utime

    x_joystick = machine.ADC(27)
    y_joystick = machine.ADC(26)

    while True:
        x_value = x_joystick.read_u16()
        y_value = y_joystick.read_u16()

        print('X: %d  Y: %d' % (x_value, y_value))
        utime.sleep_ms(200)
