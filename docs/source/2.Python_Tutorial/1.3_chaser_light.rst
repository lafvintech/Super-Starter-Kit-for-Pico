1.3 Chaser Light
====================
For our first project, we'll start with a simple yet effective task: making an LED 
blink. To achieve this, we'll use an LED Bar Graph, which consists of 10 LEDs housed 
in a plastic casing. This type of LED array is commonly used to display power levels 
or volume settings.

Schematic
^^^^^^^^^^

In the LED Bar Graph, there are 10 LEDs, each of which can be controlled individually. 
Each LED’s anode is connected to GP6*GP15, and its cathode to a 220ohm resistor, and then to GND.

Connect

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``1.3_chaser_light.py.py`` file under the path of ``Ultimate-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Python\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner. 
  
After running the code, the LED Bar Graph will display a running light effect.

The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: python
    
    import machine
    import utime

    pin = [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]
    led = []
    for i in range(10):
        led.append(None)
        led[i] = machine.Pin(pin[i], machine.Pin.OUT)

    while True:
        for i in range(10):
            led[i].value(1)  # Turn on the current LED
            utime.sleep(0.2)  # Pause for 0.2 seconds
            led[i].value(0)  # Turn off the current LED
