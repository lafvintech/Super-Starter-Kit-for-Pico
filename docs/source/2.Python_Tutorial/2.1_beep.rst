2.1 Beep
=========================
The active buzzer is a typical digital output device that is as easy to use as 
lighting up an LED. It acts like a digital output device, where you simply turn it ON or OFF.

Schematic

When GP15 outputs a high signal, the 1K current-limiting resistor protects the transistor. 
The S8050 (NPN transistor) then conducts, allowing the buzzer to sound. The S8050 transistor 
amplifies the current, making the buzzer louder. While you can connect the buzzer directly to 
GP15, the sound will be quieter without the transistor.

Connect
^^^^^^^^
Two types of buzzers are included in the kit. We need to use active buzzer. Turn 
them around, the sealed back (not the exposed PCB) is the one we want.

The buzzer needs to use a transistor when working, here we use S8050 (NPN Transistor).

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``2.1_beep.py`` file under the path of ``Ultimate-Starter-Kit-for-Pico-W\Python\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

Click “Run current script”, you will hear a beep every second.


The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: python

    import machine
    import utime

    buzzer = machine.Pin(15, machine.Pin.OUT)
    while True:
        for i in range(4):
            buzzer.value(1)
            utime.sleep(0.3)
            buzzer.value(0)
            utime.sleep(0.3)
        utime.sleep(1)
