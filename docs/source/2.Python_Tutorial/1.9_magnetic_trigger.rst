1.9 Magnetic Trigger
=========================
The most common type of reed switch contains a pair of magnetizable, flexible, m
etal reeds whose end portions are separated by a small gap when the switch is open.

A magnetic field from an electromagnet or a permanent magnet will cause the reed
s to attract each other, thus completing an electrical circuit. The spring force 
of the reeds causes them to separate, and open the circuit, when the magnetic field ceases.

A common example of a reed switch application is to detect the opening of a door 
or windows, for a security alarm.

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``1.9_magnetic_trigger.py`` file under the path of ``Ultimate-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Python\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

Click “Run current script”, GP14 goes high when a magnet is near the reed switch, other
wise it goes low.

The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: python

    import machine
    import utime
    reed = machine.Pin(14, machine.Pin.IN)
    while True:
        if reed.value() == 1:
            print("There are magnets here!!")
            utime.sleep(1)
