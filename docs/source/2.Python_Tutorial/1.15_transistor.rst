1.15 Transistor
===============================
This kit is equipped with the S8050 transistor, which is an NPN type. When a High 
level signal goes through an NPN transistor like the S8050, it is energized. This 
type of transistor is frequently used for contactless switches, just like in this 
experiment.

Schematic
^^^^^^^^^^
.. image:: img/2.sch/1.15.png

In this circuit, when the button is pressed, GP14 is high.

By programming GP15 to output high, after a 1k current limiting resistor (to 
protect the transistor), the S8050 (NPN transistor) is allowed to conduct, thus 
allowing the LED to light up.

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``1.15_two_kinds_of_transistors.py`` file under the path of ``Ultimate-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Python\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

After the program runs, The circuit using the S8050 (NPN transistor) will light 
up when the button is pressed, which means it is receiving a high-level conduction 
circuit;

The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: python

    import machine
    button = machine.Pin(14, machine.Pin.IN)
    signal = machine.Pin(15, machine.Pin.OUT)

    while True:
        button_status = button.value()
        if button_status== 1:
            signal.value(1)
        elif button_status == 0:
            signal.value(0)
