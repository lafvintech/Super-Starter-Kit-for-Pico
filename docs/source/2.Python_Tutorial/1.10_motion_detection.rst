1.10 Motion Detection
=========================
Passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is a common sensor that can measure infrared 
(IR) light emitted by objects in its field of view. Simply put, it will receive 
infrared radiation emitted from the body, thereby detecting the movement of 
people and other animals. More specifically, it tells the main control board 
that someone has entered your room.

Schematic
^^^^^^^^^^

When the PIR module detects someone passing by, GP14 will be high, otherwise it 
will be low.

.. note:: 
    The PIR module has two potentiometers: one adjusts sensitivity, the other 
    adjusts detection distance. To make the PIR module work better, you need to 
    turn both of them counterclockwise to the end.

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``1.10_motion_detection.py`` file under the path of ``Super-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Python\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

Click “Run current script”, if the PIR module detects someone nearby, the Shell will 
print out “Somebody here!”

The following is the program code:
