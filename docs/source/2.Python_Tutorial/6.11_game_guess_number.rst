6.11 Game - Guess Number
=========================
Guessing Numbers is a fun party game where you and your friends input numbers (0-99). With each input of the number, the range will shrink until a player answers the riddle correctly. Then the player is defeated and punished.

As an example, if the lucky number is 51, which the players cannot see, and the player 1 inputs 50, the prompt changes to 50 - 99; if the player 2 inputs 70, the range changes to 50 - 70; if the player 3 inputs 51, the player is unlucky. In this case, numbers are inputted through the keypad, and outcomes are displayed on a LCD screen.

Component List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Raspberry Pi Pico W x1
- MicroUSB cable x1
- 830 Tie-Points Breadboard x1
- Resistor 10KΩ x4
- 4x4 Keypad x1
- I2C LCD1602 x1
- Jumper Wire Several

Schematic
^^^^^^^^^^
.. image:: img/2.sch/6.11.png

This circuit is based on 3.2 4x4 Keypad with the addition of an I2C LCD1602 to display the pressed keys.

Connect
^^^^^^^^^

To make the wiring easier, in the above diagram, the column row of the matrix keyboard and the 10K resistors are inserted into the holes where G10 ~ G13 are located at the same time.

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``6.11_game_guess_number.py`` file under the path of ``Ultimate-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Python\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

After the code runs, press A to start the game. A random number point is produced but not displayed on the LCD, and what you need to do is to guess it.

The number you have typed appears at the end of the first line till the final calculation is finished. (Press D to start the comparation.)

The number range of point is displayed on the second line. And you must type the number within the range.

When you type a number, the range narrows; if you got the lucky number luckily or unluckily, there will appear GAME OVER!.

The following is the program code:
