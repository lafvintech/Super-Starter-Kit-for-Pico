5.3 GY521 Module
=========================
The GY-521 module is an integrated six-axis motion tracking sensor that includes a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer. It is based on the MPU-6050 chip, which is a sensor specifically designed for mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables. The GY-521 inherits the low power consumption, low cost, and high performance characteristics of the MPU-6050, meeting the stringent demands of these devices for dynamic capture and motion analysis. It is widely used in robots, game controllers, motion tracking systems, and any applications requiring precise measurement and analysis of movement data. With its I²C interface, the GY-521 can easily connect to various microcontrollers and processors, providing developers with a flexible and powerful solution.

In this experiment, use I²C to obtain the values of the three-axis acceleration sensor and three-axis gyroscope for GY-521 and display them on the screen.

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``5.3_gy521_module.py`` file under the path of ``Super-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Python\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

Click “Run current script”, you can see the 3-axis accelerometer values and 3-axis gyroscope values cycling through the output. At this point you rotate the MPU6050 at random, and these values will appear to change accordingly. To make it easier to see the changes, you can comment out one of the print lines and concentrate on another set of data.

The unit of acceleration value is m/s², and the unit of gyroscope value is °/s.

The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: python

    from imu import MPU6050
    from machine import I2C, Pin
    import time

    i2c = I2C(1, sda=Pin(6), scl=Pin(7), freq=400000)
    mpu = MPU6050(i2c)

    while True:
        print("x: %s, y: %s, z: %s"%(mpu.accel.x, mpu.accel.y, mpu.accel.z))
        time.sleep(0.5)
        print("A: %s, B: %s, Y: %s"%(mpu.gyro.x, mpu.gyro.y, mpu.gyro.z))
        time.sleep(0.5)
