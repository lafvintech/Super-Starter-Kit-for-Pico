3.3 Touch Keyboard
=========================
The MPR121 is an excellent option for adding multiple touch switches to your project. 
It features electrodes that can be extended using conductive materials. For example, 
if you connect the electrodes to a banana, you can transform the banana into a 
functional touch switch.

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``3.3_touch_keyboard.py`` file under the path of ``Ultimate-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Python\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner.

Click “Run current script”, After the program runs, you can touch the twelve electrodes on the MPR121 with your hand and the touched electrodes will be printed out.

You can extend the electrodes to connect other conductors such as fruit, wire, foil, etc. This will give you more ways to trigger these electrodes.

The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: python

    from mpr121 import MPR121
    from machine import Pin, I2C
    import time

    i2c = I2C(1, sda=Pin(6), scl=Pin(7))
    mpr = MPR121(i2c)

    # check all keys
    while True:
        value = mpr.get_all_states()
        if len(value) != 0:
            print(value)
        time.sleep_ms(100)
