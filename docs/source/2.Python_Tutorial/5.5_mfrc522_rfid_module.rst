5.5 MFRC522 RFID Module
=========================
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology that uses wireless communication between an object (or tag) and an interrogating device (or reader) to track and identify it. The tag’s transmission range is limited to several meters. Readers and tags do not necessarily require a line of sight.

An integrated circuit (IC) and an antenna are usually present on most tags. As well as storing information, the microchip manages communication with the reader via radio frequency (RF). In passive tags, there is no independent energy source and they rely on an external electromagnetic signal from the reader for power. An active tag is powered by an independent energy source, such as a battery. As a result, they may be more powerful in terms of processing, transmission, and range.

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``5.5_rfid_write.py and 5.5_rfid_read.py`` file under the path of ``Ultimate-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Python\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Don't forget to click on the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpreter in the bottom right corner. 
    
    * Here you need to use the libraries in mfrc522 folder, please check if it has been uploaded to Pico W, 可以在 Python Preparation中的上传库文件查看详情

The main function is divided into two:

.. image:: img/4.software/5.5-1.png

5.5_rfid_write.py: Used to write information to the card (or key).

After running you will be able to type message in the shell and then put the card (or key) close to the MFRC522 module to write the message in.

.. code-block:: python

    from mfrc522 import SimpleMFRC522

    reader = SimpleMFRC522(spi_id=0,sck=18,miso=16,mosi=19,cs=17,rst=9)

    def write():
        to_write = input("Please enter the message: ")
        print("Writing...Please place the card...")
        id, text = reader.write(to_write)
        print("ID: %s\nText: %s" % (id,text))

    write()

.. image:: img/4.software/5.5-2.png

5.5_rfid_read.py: used to read the information in the card (or key)

After running, you will be able to read the message stored in the card (or key).

.. code-block:: python

    from mfrc522 import SimpleMFRC522

    reader = SimpleMFRC522(spi_id=0,sck=18,miso=16,mosi=19,cs=17,rst=9)

    def read():
        print("Reading...Please place the card...")
        id, text = reader.read()
        print("ID: %s\nText: %s" % (id,text))

    read()
