2.6 Pump Control
=========================
Small centrifugal pumps are suitable for projects with automatic plant watering. It can also be used to make tiny smart water features.

Its power component is an electric motor, driven in exactly the same way as a normal motor.

.. note:: 
    
    1.Connect the tube to the motor outlet, submerge the pump in water, and then power it on.
    2.You need to make sure that the water level is always higher than the motor. Idling may damage the motor due to heat generation and will also generate noise.
    3.If you are watering plants, you need to avoid soil being drawn in, as this can clog the pump.
    4.If water does not come out of the tube, there may be residual water in the tube blocking the air flow and needs to be drained first.

.. note:: 

    * Since DC pump require a high current, we use a Li-po Charger module to power the motor here for safety reasons.

    * Make sure your Li-po Charger Module is connected as shown in the diagram. Otherwise, a short circuit will likely damage your battery and circuitry.

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``2.6_pump_control.ino`` file under the path of ``Super-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Arduino\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Or copy this code into Arduino IDE.

    * Don’t forget to select the board(Raspberry Pi Pico) and the correct port before clicking the Upload button.

Click “Run current script”, After the code is run, the pump starts working and you will see water flowing out of the tube at the same time.

The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: python

    import machine
    import utime

    # Initialize motor control pins
    motor1A = machine.Pin(14, machine.Pin.OUT)
    motor2A = machine.Pin(15, machine.Pin.OUT)
    # Add a control switch
    switch = machine.Pin(16, machine.Pin.IN, machine.Pin.PULL_UP)

    # Add a state variable to record the pump state
    pump_state = False
    # Add a variable to record the last switch state
    last_switch_state = 1  # 1 indicates not pressed

    def pump_on():
        motor1A.high()
        motor2A.low()

    def pump_off():
        motor1A.low()
        motor2A.low()

    # Initial state: Off
    pump_off()

    while True:
        current_switch_state = switch.value()

        # Detect the moment when the button changes from not pressed to pressed (falling edge)
        if current_switch_state == 0 and last_switch_state == 1:
            utime.sleep_ms(20)  # Debounce
            if switch.value() == 0:  # Confirm the button state again
                pump_state = not pump_state  # Toggle the state
                if pump_state:
                    pump_on()
                    print("power on")
                else:
                    pump_off()
                    print("power off")

        last_switch_state = current_switch_state
        utime.sleep_ms(50)  # Add a delay to avoid excessive CPU usage
