1.16 Circuit Control with Relay
==================================
In everyday life, we typically turn on or off a lamp by pressing a switch. But what 
if you want to control the lamp using the Pico W, so that it automatically turns off 
after ten minutes? A relay module can help you achieve this.

A relay module is essentially a special type of switch that is controlled by one 
side of the circuit—usually a low-voltage circuit—and used to control the other 
side of the circuit—typically a high-voltage circuit. This makes it practical to 
modify household appliances to be programmatically controlled, turning them into 
smart devices or even connecting them to the Internet.

The relay module we are using includes additional components like resistors, which 
help in safely controlling the relay and ensuring stable operation.

.. warning:: 
    
    Modification of electrical appliances comes with great danger, do not try it 
    lightly, please do it under the guidance of professionals.

Here we only use a simple circuit powered by a breadboard power module as an 
example to show how to control it using relay.

While the code is running, the LED lights up. In addition, you can hear a ticktock 
caused by breaking normally close contact and closing normally open contact.


The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: c++

    const int relayPin = 15;

    void setup() {

        pinMode(relayPin, OUTPUT);
    }


    void loop() {
        digitalWrite(relayPin, HIGH);   
        delay(2000);                     
        digitalWrite(relayPin, LOW);    
        delay(2000);                      
    }
