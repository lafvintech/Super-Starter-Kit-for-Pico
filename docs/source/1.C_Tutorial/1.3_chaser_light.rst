1.3 Chaser Light
====================
The first project is simply to make the LED blink. For this project, let’s use 
the LED Bar Graph, which contains 10 LEDs in a plastic enclosure, generally used 
to display power or volume levels.

Schematic

In the LED Bar Graph, there are 10 LEDs, each of which can be controlled individually. 
Each LED’s anode is connected to GP6*GP15, and its cathode to a 220ohm resistor, and then to GND.

Connect

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``1.3_chaser_light.ino`` file under the path of ``Super-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Arduino\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Or copy this code into Arduino IDE.

    * Don’t forget to select the board(Raspberry Pi Pico) and the correct port before clicking the Upload button.
  
After running the code, the LED Bar Graph will display a running light effect.

The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: c++
    
    void setup() {
        for(int i=6;i<=15;i++)
        {
            pinMode(i,OUTPUT);
        }
    }

    void loop() {
        for(int i=6;i<=15;i++)
        {
            digitalWrite(i,HIGH);
            delay(500);
            digitalWrite(i,LOW);
            delay(500);    
        }
    }
