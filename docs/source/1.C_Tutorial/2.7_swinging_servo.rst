2.7 Swinging Servo
=========================
In this kit, in addition to LED and passive buzzer, there is also a device controlled by PWM signal, Servo.

Servo is a position (angle) servo device, which is suitable for those control systems that require constant angle changes and can be maintained. It has been widely used in high-end remote control toys, such as airplanes, submarine models, and remote control robots.

Now, try to make the servo sway!

* Orange wire is signal and connected to GP15.

* Red wire is VCC and connected to VBUS(5V).

* Brown wire is GND and connected to GND.

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``2.7_swinging_servo.ino`` file under the path of ``Super-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Arduino\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Or copy this code into Arduino IDE.

    * Don’t forget to select the board(Raspberry Pi Pico) and the correct port before clicking the Upload button.

Click “Run current script”, we can see the Servo Arm swinging back and forth from 0° to 180°.

The program will always run because of the while True loop, we need to press the Stop button to end the program.

The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: python

    import machine
    import utime

    servo = machine.PWM(machine.Pin(15))
    servo.freq(50)

    def interval_mapping(x, in_min, in_max, out_min, out_max):
        return (x - in_min) * (out_max - out_min) / (in_max - in_min) + out_min

    def servo_write(pin,angle):
        pulse_width=interval_mapping(angle, 0, 180, 0.5,2.5)
        duty=int(interval_mapping(pulse_width, 0, 20, 0,65535))
        pin.duty_u16(duty)

    while True:
        for angle in range(180):
            servo_write(servo,angle)
            utime.sleep_ms(20)
        for angle in range(180,-1,-1):
            servo_write(servo,angle)
            utime.sleep_ms(20)
