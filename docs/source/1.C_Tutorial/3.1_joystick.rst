3.1 Joystick
=========================
If you play a lot of video games, then you should be very familiar with the Joystick. It is usually used to move the character around, rotate the screen, etc.

The principle behind Joystick’s ability to allow the computer to read our actions is very simple. It can be thought of as consisting of two potentiometers that are perpendicular to each other. These two potentiometers measure the analog value of the joystick vertically and horizontally, resulting in a value (x,y) in a planar right-angle coordinate system.

The joystick of this kit also has a digital input, which is activated when the joystick is pressed.

Schematic
^^^^^^^^^^

The SW pin is connected to a 10K pull-up resistor, the reason is to be able to 
get a stable high level on the SW pin (Z axis) when the joystick is not pressed; 
otherwise the SW is in a suspended state and the output value may vary between 0/1.

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``3.1_joystick.ino`` file under the path of ``Ultimate-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Arduino\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Or copy this code into Arduino IDE.

    * Don’t forget to select the board(Raspberry Pi Pico) and the correct port before clicking the Upload button.

Click “Run current script”, the Shell prints out the x,y,z values of joystick.

* The x-axis and y-axis values are analog values that vary from 0 to 65535.
* The Z-axis is a digital value with a status of 1 or 0.

The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: c++

    // Define analog pins for joystick X and Y axes
    const int X_PIN = A1;  // X-axis connected to analog pin A1
    const int Y_PIN = A0;  // Y-axis connected to analog pin A0

    void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);  // Initialize serial communication at 9600 baud rate
    }

    void loop() {
    // Read analog values from joystick X and Y axes
    int xValue = analogRead(X_PIN);  // Read X-axis analog value (range: 0-1023)
    int yValue = analogRead(Y_PIN);  // Read Y-axis analog value (range: 0-1023)

    // Output the read X and Y values through serial communication
    Serial.print("X: ");
    Serial.print(xValue);  // Output X-axis value
    Serial.print("  Y: ");
    Serial.println(yValue);  // Output Y-axis value and move to next line

    delay(200);  // Delay for 200 milliseconds to control reading and output frequency
    }
