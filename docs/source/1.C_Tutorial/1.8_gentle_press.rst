1.8 Gentle Press
===================
A micro switch is a 3-pin device, with the pins labeled as C (common), NO (normally open), 
and NC (normally closed). When the switch is not pressed, the common pin (C) is connected to 
the normally closed pin (NC). When the switch is pressed, the common pin (C) connects to the 
normally open pin (NO) instead.

By default, GP14 is in a low state. When the micro switch is pressed, GP14 goes high.

The 10K resistor ensures that GP14 remains low when the switch is not pressed, 
providing a stable low state.

Additionally, the 104 ceramic capacitor is used to filter out any electrical noise 
or jitter that might occur during switching.

After the program runs, when you toggle the slide switch to the right, “The swit
ch works!” will appear in the shell.

The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: c++

    const int limitPin = 14;
    int state = 0;

    void setup() {
    pinMode(limitPin, INPUT);
    Serial.begin(115200);
    }

    void loop() {
    state = digitalRead(limitPin);
    if (state == HIGH) {
        Serial.println("The switch works!");
    }
    }
