5.4 IR Remote Control
=========================
In consumer electronics, remote controls are used to operate devices such as televisions and DVD players. In some cases, remote controls allow people to operate devices that are out of their reach, such as central air conditioners.

IR Receiver is a component with photocell that is tuned to receive to infrared light. It is almost always used for remote control detection - every TV and DVD player has one of these in the front to receive for the IR signal from the clicker. Inside the remote control is a matching IR LED, which emits IR pulses to tell the TV to turn on, off or change channels.

The new remote control has a plastic piece at the end to isolate the battery inside. You need to pull out this plastic piece to power up the remote when you are using it. Once the program is running, when you press the remote control, the Shell will print out the key you pressed.

The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: c++

    #include "IR.h"
    #define IR_Pin 17

    String decodeKeyValue(unsigned long data) {
    switch (data) {
        case 0xFF629D: return "UP";
        case 0xFFA857: return "DOWN";
        case 0xFF22DD: return "LEFT";
        case 0xFFC23D: return "RIGHT";
        case 0xFF02FD: return "OK";
        case 0xFF6897: return "1";
        case 0xFF9867: return "2";
        case 0xFFB04F: return "3";
        case 0xFF30CF: return "4";
        case 0xFF18E7: return "5";
        case 0xFF7A85: return "6";
        case 0xFF10EF: return "7";
        case 0xFF38C7: return "8";
        case 0xFF5AA5: return "9";
        case 0xFF4AB5: return "0";
        case 0xFF42BD: return "*";
        case 0xFF52AD: return "#";
        default: 
        // For debugging: print the received code
        Serial.print("Raw IR Code: 0x");
        Serial.println(data, HEX);
        return "ERROR";
    }
    }

    void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    IR_Init(IR_Pin);
    }

    void loop() {
    if(flagCode) {
        unsigned long irValue = IR_Decode(flagCode);
        if(irValue != 0xFFFFFFFF) {  // Ignore repeat codes
        String keyName = decodeKeyValue(irValue);
        Serial.println(keyName);
        }
        IR_Release();
    }
    }
