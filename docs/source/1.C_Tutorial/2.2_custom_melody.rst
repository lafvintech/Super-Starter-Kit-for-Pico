2.2 Custom Melody
=========================
We have used active buzzer in the previous project, this time we will use passive buzzer.

Like the active buzzer, the passive buzzer also uses the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction to work. The difference is that a passive buzzer does not have oscillating source, so it will not beep if DC signals are used. But this allows the passive buzzer to adjust its own oscillation frequency and can emit different notes such as “doh, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti”.

Let the passive buzzer emit a melody!

Schematic

When the GP15 output is high, after the 1K current limiting resistor (to protect the transistor), the S8050 (NPN transistor) will conduct, so that the buzzer will sound.

The role of S8050 (NPN transistor) is to amplify the current and make the buzzer sound louder. In fact, you can also connect the buzzer directly to GP15, but you will find that the buzzer sound is smaller.

Connect
^^^^^^^^
Two buzzers are included in the kit, we use a passive buzzer (one with an exposed PCB on the back).

The buzzer needs a transistor to work, here we use S8050.

Code
^^^^^^^
.. note::

    * Open the ``2.2_beep.ino`` file under the path of ``Ultimate-Starter-Kit-for-Pico\Arduino\1.Project`` or copy this code into Thonny, then click "Run Current Script" or simply press F5 to run it.

    * Or copy this code into Arduino IDE.

    * Don’t forget to select the board(Raspberry Pi Pico) and the correct port before clicking the Upload button.

Click “Run current script”, you will hear a beep every second.

The following is the program code:

.. code-block:: c++

    #include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>
    #ifdef __AVR__
    #include <avr/power.h>
    #endif


    #define PIXEL_PIN    0
    #define PIXEL_COUNT 8

    // Declare our NeoPixel strip object:
    Adafruit_NeoPixel strip(PIXEL_COUNT, PIXEL_PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);
    // Argument 1 = Number of pixels in NeoPixel strip
    // Argument 2 = Arduino pin number (most are valid)
    // Argument 3 = Pixel type flags, add together as needed:
    //   NEO_KHZ800  800 KHz bitstream (most NeoPixel products w/WS2812 LEDs)
    //   NEO_KHZ400  400 KHz (classic 'v1' (not v2) FLORA pixels, WS2811 drivers)
    //   NEO_GRB     Pixels are wired for GRB bitstream (most NeoPixel products)
    //   NEO_RGB     Pixels are wired for RGB bitstream (v1 FLORA pixels, not v2)
    //   NEO_RGBW    Pixels are wired for RGBW bitstream (NeoPixel RGBW products)


    void setup() {
    strip.begin(); // Initialize NeoPixel strip object (REQUIRED)
    strip.show();  // Initialize all pixels to 'off'

    strip.setPixelColor(0, strip.Color(64, 154, 227));       //  Set pixel's color (in RAM)
    strip.setPixelColor(1, strip.Color(128, 0, 128));
    strip.setPixelColor(2, strip.Color(50, 150, 50));
    strip.setPixelColor(3, strip.Color(255, 30, 30));
    strip.setPixelColor(4, strip.Color(0, 128, 255));
    strip.setPixelColor(5, strip.Color(99, 199, 0));
    strip.setPixelColor(6, strip.Color(64, 154, 227));
    strip.setPixelColor(7, strip.Color(255, 100, 0));
    strip.show();                          //  Update strip to match
    }

    void loop() {

    }
